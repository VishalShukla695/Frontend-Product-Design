## Getting Started

 **Explore the Structure:**
Take a moment to review the project structure:

        |-- index.html
        |-- style.css
        |-- script.js
        |-- assets
- `index.html`: The main HTML file for my project.
- `style.css`: CSS file for styling.
- `script.js`: JavaScript file for scripting logic.
- `README.md`: Documentation for your project.
- `assets`: This folder contains all images.
